# Python Guide on micro:bit - Introduction

## About this guide

When Guido van Rossum created the Python programming language in 1989, it was meant to be an easy-to-use general-purpose programming language. And it still is today; Python is indeed very easy to learn, from the start at least, but there are so many short-cuts and hidden features that can easily confuse beginners and even veterans. Also, a lot of stuff in Python jsut don't work like the ways in other languages (C/C++, Java, even the TypeScript blocks in the MakeCode editor for micro:bit).

Another problem is that the purpose of learning Python is now almost exclusively for learning data science/data analysis, since there are so many popular third party packages designed for Python. These tools only require minimum Python; since data analysis job demands are high, this is probably why so many people - especially people with no IT backgrounds - are learning Python now.

Personally, I think Python on embedded device - MicroPython - is another great path you can try. Instead of manipulating pure data on your computer, you can design devices that actually intract with the environment and solve real-life problems. You'll need to think differently compared to writing single-use data analysis codes because your program will have to run as long as it can. It helped a lot for my own Python skills.

From the beginning, the BBC micro:bit microtontroller is already designed to use MicroPython, but most of the guides are more focused on what micro:bits can do instead of what Python can do. And this is where this guide comes in: to learn proper, correct Python concepts/grammers with the help of micro:bit features.

So I am not writing this guide for children; this is for teachers and (young) adults who are interested in learning Python from scratch (no pun intended) on micro:bits. This is also a free project, so please give me a issue if you have trouble to understand anything.
