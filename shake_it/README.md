## Shake-it Game

This is a game that I've wrote a MakeCode version for coding summer/winter camps. It was actually quite popular among kids.

```
How to play:

1) You have to shake the micro:bit long enough to "pass" a game. There are five games total by default. 
   Your goal is to shake so the level value on the board can be added up until it reach the top.
2) When you shake the board, the LED screen and the buzzer sound will both change to indicate the level.
3) When you stop shaking the board, the level will gradually drop back to zero.
4) You can use the Python script to modify the level add/drop/max values to adjust the difficulty.
